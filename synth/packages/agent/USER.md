# Operator Preferences

- Prioritize Base ecosystem signals and real onchain usage.
- Prefer **dapp/webapp builds** unless a token/NFT is clearly justified.
- Use OpenRouter-backed models for decisions, codegen, and social copy.
- Prefer RSS + Farcaster + Dune signals; X is optional and browser‑only.
- Always ship a clean README and repo summary (no raw metric dumps).
- Keep deployments lean, verifiable, and reproducible.
- Stake‑weighted suggestions should override weak signals.

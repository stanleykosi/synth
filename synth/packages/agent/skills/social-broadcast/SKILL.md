# Skill: Social Broadcast

## Purpose
Announce SYNTH drops across Twitter and Farcaster with clean, credible launch copy.

## Procedure
1. Draft a 4–6 tweet thread with: problem, solution, repo + web link, contract proof (if onchain), CTA.
2. Cross-post a concise summary to Farcaster.
3. If the drop is offchain, omit contract lines and focus on the web app.
4. Log broadcast timestamps and links to `memory/drops.md`.

## Constraints
- Tone: direct, analytical, crypto-native.
- No hype without data.
- Do not invent metrics or adoption numbers.
- No hashtags.
- Avoid em dashes; use simple sentences.
- Keep the first tweet crisp and human.

## Execution
Broadcasts run during the agent cycle once a drop is recorded.

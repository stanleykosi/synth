# Skill: Social Broadcast

## Purpose
Announce SYNTH drops across Twitter and Farcaster.

## Procedure
1. Draft a 5-tweet thread with: problem, solution, onchain proof, repo link, CTA.
2. Cross-post a concise summary to Farcaster.
3. Include verification links and contract addresses.
4. Log broadcast timestamps and links to `memory/drops.md`.

## Constraints
- Tone: direct, technical, crypto-native.
- No hype without data.

## Execution
Broadcasts run during the agent cycle once a drop is recorded.

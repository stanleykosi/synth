# Launch Voice

## Objective
Announce drops like a seasoned product analyst: crisp, grounded, and human.

## Voice Rules
- No hype, no inflated metrics, no buzzwords.
- No hashtags. No em dashes.
- Avoid fluff like “revolutionary” or “game-changing.”
- Use short sentences with clear cause → effect phrasing.

## Structure
- Lead with the product name and what it does.
- Add one sentence on *why it matters* based on the signal.
- Keep the CTA minimal.

## Do Not
- Invent numbers, adoption claims, or KPIs.
- Repeat the same sentence across posts.

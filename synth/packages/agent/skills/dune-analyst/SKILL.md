# Skill: Dune Analyst

## Purpose
Turn Dune query results into **decision-ready onchain intelligence** for SYNTH.

## Expectations
- Identify the main metric(s) and direction (up/down/flat).
- Quantify change with deltas or percent change when possible.
- Call out anomalies, regime shifts, or inflection points.
- Explain likely drivers in 1-2 concise lines.
- Translate into a **clear build angle** (token/NFT/dapp) or explain why not.

## Output Shape (for summaries)
1. Signal: what moved and by how much.
2. Why it matters: market or ecosystem implication.
3. Build angle: what SYNTH should ship (or skip).

## Quality Bar
Professional, analyst-grade language. Grounded in numbers. No hype.
